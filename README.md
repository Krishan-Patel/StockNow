# StockNow

## Live Stock Statitics Viewing Website

StockNow is a Full-Stack website I developed that features: 
- live stock statistics for 500+ stocks from the New York Stock Exchange with data updated every 5 minutes.
- Django Authentication to implement user validation allowing users to register, log in, log out etc.
  - Logged in memebers can save their favourite stocks to the homepage with the favouriting feature.
- Heroku for hosting and WhiteNoise for static files 
- PostgresSQL backend with data updated to the backend speeding up website response times ~10X for better user experience.

The motivation behind StockNow was to create a fullstack website that allowed me to keep up with stocks prices in a simple and easy way. StockNow lets users search 
statitics for 500+ stocks and favourite stocks to view them on their homepage for easy and quick access.
